I'm a former IT Project Manager and Business Analyst who has moved over to the dark side and learnt to code at Makers Academy. I've led tech projects at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and the Bank of England, but now want to use my analysis and problem solving skills to make stuff.

  I'm looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role where I can continue to learn something new every day, in an organisation that loves agile practices as much as it loves going the extra mile to make people's lives better.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career I have acted as a translator between the technical and non-technical; whether as a Business Analyst writing business requirements, a Project Manager gaining agreement to deploy new software, or a Junior Developer writing code based on user stories.

Whilst at Makers Academy I have maintained a [blog](http://sophgill.wordpress.com) about learning to code. I also prepared and delivered two workshops, mentored two juniors from the lower cohort, and rewrote a Makers Academy course material about sharing Github repositories to improve the process for future cohorts.

#### Problem-solving

I am highly experienced in identifying business and systems issues, then working with users and developers to build solutions to these problems.

As a developer this skill enables me to spot and resolve issues before they impact the user experience. For example during the development of the multiplayer game Quizzbuzz at Makers Academy, I identified that if a user left a game any remaining players would be stuck on the current question. To resolve this I suggested a solution which notified the remaining players that the game had ended, and gave them the option to start a new game.

#### Analysis

My years as a Business Analyst have proved brilliant preparation for life as a developer. I am able to turn vague ideas into actionable user stories, and enjoy using these to guide my development process.

I pick up new concepts with ease, and focus on asking the right questions to further my understanding of new ideas. These skills served me well when I worked in three different sectors within 18 months (Banking, Charity and NHS), and I was able to understand the specific business problems and requirements of each organisation to quickly gain the trust of project stakeholders.

#### Additional Skills

- Scrum (previously completed Scrum Master certification)
- Kanban
- ISEB Foundation certificate
- Full project lifecycle experience
